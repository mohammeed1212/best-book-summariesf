      <h2>Part One: The Disgraced Journalist & the Mysterious Offer</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Mikael Blomkvist’s Downfall</strong></p>
      <p>The novel opens with Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist and co-founder of Millennium, a Swedish magazine that exposes corporate corruption. He has just lost a libel case against powerful billionaire Hans-Erik Wennerström after publishing accusations of financial misconduct without sufficient evidence. As a result:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He is convicted of libel, fined a significant amount, and sentenced to three months in prison.</li>
        <li>His reputation is damaged, and Millennium faces a financial crisis.</li>
        <li>To protect the magazine, he steps away from his role for a while.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2. Henrik Vanger’s Proposition</strong></p>
      <p>Mikael is soon contacted by Henrik Vanger, the aging former CEO of the powerful Vanger Corporation. Henrik makes him an unusual offer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>He wants Mikael to investigate the 40-year-old disappearance of his grand-niece, Harriet Vanger, who vanished in 1966 from the family’s island estate.</li>
        <li>In exchange, Henrik promises to provide Mikael with solid evidence that will destroy Wennerström’s reputation.</li>
        <li>Although skeptical, Mikael agrees after Henrik offers him a substantial financial reward.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>3. Lisbeth Salander—The Brilliant but Troubled Hacker</strong></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we are introduced to Lisbeth Salander, a socially withdrawn yet highly intelligent hacker working for Milton Security.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She has an eidetic memory and exceptional hacking skills.</li>
        <li>She is declared legally incompetent and is under the guardianship of Holger Palmgren, a kind man who respects her independence.</li>
        <li>However, when Palmgren suffers a stroke, Lisbeth is placed under the control of Nils Bjurman, a sadistic lawyer who abuses his power over her.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>1. The Vanger Family & Its Dark History</strong></p>
      <p>Mikael moves into a cottage on Hedeby Island, home to the Vanger family’s wealthy yet dysfunctional dynasty. Key family members include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Martin Vanger – Harriet’s older brother and the current CEO of Vanger Corporation.</li>
        <li>Isabella Vanger – Harriet’s cold and distant mother.</li>
        <li>Cecilia Vanger – Harriet’s cousin, who takes an interest in Mikael.</li>
        <li>Gottfried Vanger (deceased) – A former patriarch known for his abusive behavior.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mikael sifts through old police reports, photographs, and family records related to Harriet’s disappearance.</p>
      <p><strong>2. The Last Known Moments of Harriet</strong></p>
      <p>Mikael reconstructs Harriet’s final known movements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She vanished during a Vanger family gathering in 1966.</li>
        <li>The island was sealed off due to a bridge accident, making escape impossible.</li>
        <li>She appeared distressed before she disappeared.</li>
        <li>Every year, Henrik Vanger receives a pressed flower on his birthday, a tradition Harriet once kept—suggesting someone knows what happened to her.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mikael begins to suspect that Harriet may have been murdered by someone in the family.</p>
