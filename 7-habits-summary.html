  <section class="container my-5">

    <!-- Page 1: Introduction and Habits 1-2 -->
    <div id="page-1" class="summary-section section">
      <h2>Habit 1: Be Proactive</h2>
      <p>This habit focuses on taking responsibility for your actions and behaviors. Proactive people recognize that they are "response-able" — meaning they have the ability to choose their responses to any given situation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proactive people don’t blame their circumstances, conditions, or others for their behavior.</li>
        <li>Covey introduces the idea of the Circle of Influence and the Circle of Concern.</li>
        <li>Proactive people focus their energy on expanding their Circle of Influence rather than dwelling on things in the Circle of Concern.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="quote">Example: If you’re stuck in traffic, a proactive person would choose to stay calm and use the time to listen to an audiobook or reflect, rather than getting frustrated or upset by the delay.</p>

      <h2>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</h2>
      <p>This habit is about envisioning what you want to achieve in the future so that you can plan and work towards it with a clear vision. It’s about defining your life goals and making sure that your actions align with your values and long-term objectives.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Covey emphasizes the importance of having a personal mission statement.</li>
        <li>By starting with the end in mind, you ensure that your daily actions are in service of your greater vision.</li>
        <li>Example: If your long-term goal is to be a successful entrepreneur, you start by defining what success means to you and aligning every decision with that goal.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Page 2: Habits 3-4 -->
    <div id="page-2" class="summary-section section">
      <h2>Habit 3: Put First Things First</h2>
      <p>This habit is about managing your time and energy to focus on what’s most important, rather than getting caught up in urgent but unimportant tasks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Covey breaks tasks into four quadrants: Urgent & Important, Not Urgent but Important, Urgent but Not Important, Not Urgent and Not Important.</li>
        <li>The key message is to prioritize activities in Quadrant II — tasks that are important but not immediately urgent.</li>
        <li>Example: Instead of responding immediately to every email, schedule focused time to work on important projects that move you closer to your goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Habit 4: Think Win-Win</h2>
      <p>This habit encourages creating solutions that benefit everyone involved, rather than fostering competition. It’s about striving for mutual benefit and collaboration in all relationships and situations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Win-Win is based on an abundance mindset, the belief that there’s enough success, resources, and recognition for everyone.</li>
        <li>Example: In a business negotiation, aim to find a deal that works for both sides, ensuring that both parties feel they are receiving fair value.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Page 3: Habits 5-6 -->
    <div id="page-3" class="summary-section section">
      <h2>Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</h2>
      <p>Effective communication starts with truly understanding the other person’s perspective before expressing your own viewpoint. This habit stresses the importance of active listening.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most people listen with the intention of replying, not understanding.</li>
        <li>Empathetic listening means listening with the intent to understand, not just to respond.</li>
        <li>Example: In a team meeting, take time to listen to your colleagues’ perspectives, understanding their points of view before sharing your thoughts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Habit 6: Synergize</h2>
      <p>Synergy is about teamwork and collaboration, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It’s about recognizing that diverse perspectives and skills can lead to better solutions than working alone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Synergy fosters creativity and innovation through cooperation and collaboration.</li>
        <li>Example: In a group project, collaborate with team members who have different skills to come up with innovative solutions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Page 4: Habit 7 and Conclusion -->
    <div id="page-4" class="summary-section section">
      <h2>Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw</h2>
      <p>This final habit focuses on regular self-renewal and improvement. It’s about maintaining balance and continual growth in four key areas: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical: Take care of your body through exercise, diet, and rest.</li>
        <li>Mental: Continuously engage in learning, reading, and developing new skills.</li>
        <li>Emotional: Build strong relationships, practice empathy, and stay connected with others.</li>
        <li>Spiritual: Reflect on your values, meditate, or engage in practices that bring you peace and purpose.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="quote">Example: Taking regular breaks from work to exercise or meditate allows you to come back to your tasks with renewed energy and focus.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Stephen Covey’s "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" provides a comprehensive framework for personal and professional development. By applying these seven habits, individuals can become more proactive, aligned with their values, and effective in achieving their goals.</p>
      <p class="quote">The key to success is not just in understanding these habits but in consistently practicing them to build a foundation for a balanced and fulfilling life.</p>
