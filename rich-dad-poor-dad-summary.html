      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a financial self-help book that challenges conventional wisdom about money, work, and wealth accumulation. Robert Kiyosaki presents the lessons he learned from his "two dads"—his biological father (Poor Dad) and his best friend’s father (Rich Dad).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Poor Dad:</strong> A highly educated man with a Ph.D. who worked as a government employee but struggled financially. He believed in job security, saving money, and relying on a pension.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Dad:</strong> A businessman who dropped out of school but became a millionaire through entrepreneurship and investments. He believed in financial education, making money work for you, and achieving financial independence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The book emphasizes financial intelligence, teaching readers how to escape the "rat race" and build wealth through smart investments.</p>

      <h2>Key Lessons from the Book</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>The Importance of Financial Education</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Schools teach people how to work for money, but they don’t teach how to make money work for them.</li>
            <li>People should learn about assets, liabilities, and financial independence.</li>
            <li>Knowledge is more valuable than money because it leads to wealth creation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="quote">"The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is trained well, it can create enormous wealth."</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Difference Between Assets and Liabilities</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Assets put money in your pocket (e.g., rental properties, stocks, businesses).</li>
            <li>Liabilities take money out of your pocket (e.g., loans, mortgages, credit card debt).</li>
            <li>The rich buy assets, while the poor and middle class accumulate liabilities, thinking they are assets (like houses and cars).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="quote">Key Lesson: If you want to be rich, buy assets and minimize liabilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Rat Race vs. Financial Freedom</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Most people are trapped in a cycle of earning, spending, and borrowing (The Rat Race).</li>
            <li>They work for money, but the rich make money work for them through investments.</li>
            <li>Job security is an illusion; financial security comes from passive income.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="quote">"The poor and middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them."</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="page-3" class="summary-section section">
      <h2>More Key Lessons</h2>
      <ol start="4">
        <li><strong>Mindset and Fear: Overcoming the Psychological Barriers to Wealth</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Fear and self-doubt stop people from taking financial risks.</li>
            <li>Most people are afraid of losing money, so they avoid investing.</li>
            <li>The rich take calculated risks and learn from failures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="quote">Key Lesson: Learn to manage fear, laziness, bad habits, arrogance, and self-doubt, which are obstacles to financial success.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Power of Entrepreneurship and Passive Income</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A job provides temporary security, but true wealth comes from owning businesses and investments.</li>
            <li>The rich don’t just work for a paycheck; they build passive income streams (rental income, dividends, royalties, etc.).</li>
            <li>Business owners and investors get tax advantages that employees don’t.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="quote">Key Lesson: If you want to be rich, stop working for others and start owning income-generating assets.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Importance of Financial Literacy</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Financial literacy means understanding how money works: taxes, investments, debt, real estate, and business principles.</li>
            <li>The rich understand how to use leverage (borrowed money) to build wealth.</li>
            <li>The poor and middle class work hard to pay taxes, while the rich use tax laws to their advantage.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="quote">Key Example: An employee earns $100,000, pays 30% in taxes, and has $70,000 left. A business owner earns $100,000, reinvests money, and only pays tax on what remains.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="quote">"In the real world, it’s not the smart who get ahead, but the bold."</p>
      <p><strong>Would I Recommend This Book?</strong> Yes, especially for those who want to break free from financial struggles and build lasting wealth.</p>
